# ProfilesAndSettings

This Repository contains all my PowerShell profiles, VSCode settings and Windows Terminal settings.
There are also some scripts to install my favorite applications and PowerShell modules.
It might contain other stuff in the future, but it's basically used for the configuration of my computer and all my code editing tools.

## Installation
The PowerShell profiles can be used in PowerShell by editing, replacing your own PowerShell profile. You can find the location and name of your profile by typing `$PROFILE` in your PowerShell session. 

More information about PowerShell Profiles can be found from the PowerShell help file:

From within PowerShell
